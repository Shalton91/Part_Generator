# Part_Generator
This tool is designed to speed up the creation of the 2D and 3D models of parts and then add them to the configurator. 
Currently this only supports gear's bodies and quadrants but can be expanded. 

My hope was to integrate bluestar upload once I cracked the API and could automate the upload.
